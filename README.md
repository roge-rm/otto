##### a standalone battery (and pi) powered USB MIDI host & router

USB MIDI is great but a real pain in the ass when you're away from a computer. This project aims to fix that by providing a cheap and simple way to DIY yourself out of the connection problem.

Parts required:
* <a href=https://geekworm.com/products/x306>Geekworm X306 USB Hub/UPS Expansion board for Raspberry Pi Zero W/2W</a>
* Raspberry Pi Zero W or 2W
* 4GB or larger microSD card
* 18650 battery

I purchased the Geekworm X306 board from Aliexpress, you can choose to buy it with or without a heatsink. I am not sure a heatsink is required but I feel like extra passive cooling is always a good idea.
