USB MIDI is great but a real pain in the ass when you're away from a computer. This project aims to fix that by providing a cheap and simple way to DIY yourself out of the connection problem.

Parts required:
* <a href=https://geekworm.com/products/x306>Geekworm X306 USB Hub/UPS Expansion board for Raspberry Pi Zero W/2W</a> (heatsink optional?)
* Raspberry Pi Zero W or 2W
* 4GB or larger microSD card
