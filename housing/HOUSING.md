# otto - 3D printable housing

Parts needed to assemble:
* 3D printer (or access to one)
* filament - I used PLA, you can use whatever you're comfortable with
* 4 x m3\*4.6\*4.0 heat insert nuts
* 4 x m3\*5 bolts
* 4 x m2.5\*6 bolts
* 2 x m2.5\*8 bolts
* 2 x m2.5 nuts

**You can skip the heat insert nuts if you use longer m3 bolts and print the special <a href=https://github.com/roge-rm/otto/blob/main/housing/top%20v17%20nonuts.stl>nonut</a> housing. <br>
This housing has thinner holes so you can force bolts into them and make your own threads.**

1. Print the <a href=https://github.com/roge-rm/otto/blob/main/housing/top%20v17.stl>top</a> and <a href=https://github.com/roge-rm/otto/blob/main/housing/bottom%20v17.stl>bottom</a> housings at whatever level of detail suits you in whatever material makes you happy. I printed mine in PLA at 0.3mm layer height.
2. Insert the heat insert nuts into the appropriately sized holes i.n the top housing. I like to stick mine on the end of my soldering iron and gently work it in.

3. Mount the X306 board to the bottom housing<br>
The 4 m2.5\*5 bolts grab onto the same posts the Pi mounted to (but from the bottom).<br>
The 2 m2.5\*8 bolts go through the holes on either side of the USB ports/power switch and are held in place by the m2.5 nuts.

4. Mount the top housing to the bottom housing and secure with the m3\*5 bolts.<br>
It is easier to do without the microSD card installed but if you angle the housings together you can work your way around them.

Done!
