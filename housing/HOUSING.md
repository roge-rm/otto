# otto - 3D printable housing

Parts needed to assemble:
* 3D printer (or access to one)
* Filament - I used PLA, you can use whatever you're comfortable with
* 4 x m3*4.6*4.0 heat insert nuts
* 4 x m3*5 bolts
* 4 x m2.5*5 bolts
* 2 x m2.5*8 bolts
* 2 x m2.5 nuts

You can skip the heat insert nuts if you use longer m3 bolts and print the special *nonut* housing. <br>
This housing has thinner holes so you can force bolts into them and make your own threads.
